Text Field

The Text Field is one of the most commonly used fields. It saves a string to the database and provides the Admin Panel with a simple text input.

Admin Options

To customize the appearance and behavior of the Text Field in the Admin Panel, you can use the admin option:

1import type { Field } from 'payload'
2

3export const MyTextField: Field = {
4  // ...
5  admin: {
6    
7    // ...
8  },
9}

The Text Field inherits all of the default admin options from the base Field Admin Config, plus the following additional options:

Option

	

Description




placeholder

	

Set this property to define a placeholder string in the text input.




autoComplete

	

Set this property to a string that will be used for browser autocomplete.

Slug Field

The slug field is experimental and may change, or even be removed, in future releases. Use at your own risk.

One common use case for the Text Field is to create a "slug" for a document. A slug is a unique, indexed, URL-friendly string that identifies a particular document, often used to construct the URL of a webpage.

Payload provides a built-in Slug Field so you don't have to built one from scratch. This field automatically generates a slug based on the value of another field, such as a title or name field. It provides UI to lock and unlock the field to protect its value, as well as to re-generate the slug on-demand.

To add a Slug Field, import the slugField into your field schema:

1import { slugField } from 'payload'
2import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
3

4export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
5  // ...
6  fields: [
7    // ...
8    
9    slugField(),
10    
11  ],
12}

The slug field exposes a few top-level config options for easy customization:

Option

	

Description




name

	

To be used as the slug field's name. Defaults to slug.




overrides

	

A function that receives the default fields so you can override on a granular level. See example below. More details.




checkboxName

	

To be used as the name for the generateSlug checkbox field. Defaults to generateSlug.




fieldToUse

	

The name of the field to use when generating the slug. This field must exist in the same collection. Defaults to title.




localized

	

Enable localization on the slug and generateSlug fields. Defaults to false.




position

	

The position of the slug field. More details.




required

	

Require the slug field. Defaults to true.

Slug Overrides

If the above options aren't sufficient for your use case, you can use the overrides function to customize the slug field at a granular level. The overrides function receives the default fields that make up the slug field, and you can modify them to any extent you need.

1import { slugField } from 'payload'
2import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
3

4export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
5  // ...
6  fields: [
7    // ...
8    
9    slugField({
10      overrides: (defaultField) => {
11        defaultField.fields[1].label = 'Custom Slug Label'
12        return defaultField
13      },
14    }),
15    
16  ],
17}
