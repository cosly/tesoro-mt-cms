Field-level Access Control

Field Access Control is Access Control used to restrict access to specific Fields within a Document.

To add Access Control to a Field, use the access property in your Field Config:

1import type { Field } from 'payload'
2

3export const FieldWithAccessControl: Field = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    
7    // ...
8  },
9}

Note: Field Access Control does not support returning Query constraints like Collection Access Control does.
