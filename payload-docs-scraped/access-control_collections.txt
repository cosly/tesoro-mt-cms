Collection Access Control

Collection Access Control is Access Control used to restrict access to Documents within a Collection, as well as what they can and cannot see within the Admin Panel as it relates to that Collection.

To add Access Control to a Collection, use the access property in your Collection Config:

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const CollectionWithAccessControl: CollectionConfig = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    
7    // ...
8  },
9}
Config Options

Access Control is specific to the operation of the request.

To add Access Control to a Collection, use the access property in your Collection Config:

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload';
2

3export const CollectionWithAccessControl: CollectionConfig = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    create: () => {...},
7    read: () => {...},
8    update: () => {...},
9    delete: () => {...},
10

11    // Auth-enabled Collections only
12    admin: () => {...},
13    unlock: () => {...},
14

15    // Version-enabled Collections only
16    readVersions: () => {...},
17  },
18}

The following options are available:

Function

	

Allows/Denies Access




create

	

Used in the create operation. More details.




read

	

Used in the find and findByID operations. More details.




update

	

Used in the update operation. More details.




delete

	

Used in the delete operation. More details.

If a Collection supports Authentication, the following additional options are available:

Function

	

Allows/Denies Access




admin

	

Used to restrict access to the Admin Panel. More details.




unlock

	

Used to restrict which users can access the unlock operation. More details.

If a Collection supports Versions, the following additional options are available:

Function

	

Allows/Denies Access




readVersions

	

Used to control who can read versions, and who can't. Will automatically restrict the Admin UI version viewing access. More details.

Create

Returns a boolean which allows/denies access to the create request.

To add create Access Control to a Collection, use the create property in the Collection Config:

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const CollectionWithCreateAccess: CollectionConfig = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    create: ({ req: { user }, data }) => {
7      return Boolean(user)
8    },
9  },
10}

The following arguments are provided to the create function:

Option

	

Description




req

	

The Request object containing the currently authenticated user.




data

	

The data passed to create the document with.

Read

Returns a boolean which allows/denies access to the read request.

To add read Access Control to a Collection, use the read property in the Collection Config:

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const CollectionWithReadAccess: CollectionConfig = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    read: ({ req: { user } }) => {
7      return Boolean(user)
8    },
9  },
10}

Tip: Return a Query to limit the Documents to only those that match the constraint. This can be helpful to restrict users' access to specific Documents. More details.

As your application becomes more complex, you may want to define your function in a separate file and import them into your Collection Config:

1import type { Access } from 'payload'
2

3export const canReadPage: Access = ({ req: { user } }) => {
4  // Allow authenticated users
5  if (user) {
6    return true
7  }
8

9  // By returning a Query, guest users can read public Documents
10  // Note: this assumes you have a `isPublic` checkbox field on your Collection
11  return {
12    isPublic: {
13      equals: true,
14    },
15  }
16}

The following arguments are provided to the read function:

Option

	

Description




req

	

The Request object containing the currently authenticated user.




id

	

id of document requested, if within findByID.

Update

Returns a boolean which allows/denies access to the update request.

To add update Access Control to a Collection, use the update property in the Collection Config:

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const CollectionWithUpdateAccess: CollectionConfig = {
4  // ...
5  access: {
6    update: ({ req: { user } }) => {
7      return Boolean(user)
8    },
9  },
10}

Tip: Return a Query to limit the Documents to only those that match the constraint. This can be helpful to restrict users' access to specific Documents. More details.

As your application becomes more complex, you may want to define your function in a separate file and import them into your Collection Config:

1import type { Access } from 'payload'
2

3export const canUpdateUser: Access = ({ req: { user }, id }) => {
4  // Allow users with a role of 'admin'
5  if (user.roles && user.roles.some((role) => role === 'admin')) {
6    return true
7  }
8

9  // allow any other users to update only oneself
10  return user.id === id
11}

The following arguments are provided to the update function:

Option

	

Description




req

6    delete: ({ req: { user } }) => {
7      return Boolean(user)
8    },
9  },
10}

As your application becomes more complex, you may want to define your function in a separate file and import them into your Collection Config:

1import type { Access } from 'payload'
2

3export const canDeleteCustomer: Access = async ({ req, id }) => {
4  if (!id) {
5    // allow the admin UI to show controls to delete since it is indeterminate without the `id`
6    return true
7  }
8

9  // Query another Collection using the `id`
10  const result = await req.payload.find({
11    collection: 'contracts',
12    limit: 0,
13    depth: 0,
14    where: {
15      customer: { equals: id },

Unlock

Determines which users can unlock other users who may be blocked from authenticating successfully due to failing too many login attempts.
