Group Field

The Group Field allows Fields to be nested under a common property name. It also groups fields together visually in the Admin Panel.

To add a Group Field, set the type to group in your Field Config:

1import type { Field } from 'payload'
2

3export const MyGroupField: Field = {
4  // ...
5  type: 'group',
6  fields: [
7    // ...
8  ],
9}
Config Options

Option

	

Description




name

	

To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database. More details.




fields *

	

Array of field types to nest within this Group.




label

	

Used as a heading in the Admin Panel and to name the generated GraphQL type. Defaults to the field name, if defined.

Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin Panel and the backend. More details.




saveToJWT

	

If this field is top-level and nested in a config supporting Authentication, include its data in the user JWT.

Provide Field Hooks to control logic for this field. More details.




access

	

Provide Field Access Control to denote what users can see and do with this field's data. More details.

Provide an object of data to be used for this field's default value. More details.




localized

	

Enable localization for this field. Requires localization to be enabled in the Base config. If enabled, a separate, localized set of all data within this Group will be kept, so there is no need to specify each nested field as localized.

Admin-specific configuration. More details.




custom

	

Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)




interfaceName

	

Create a top level, reusable Typescript interface & GraphQL type.

Admin Options

To customize the appearance and behavior of the Group Field in the Admin Panel, you can use the admin option:

1import type { Field } from 'payload'
2

3export const MyGroupField: Field = {
4  // ...
5  admin: {
6    
7    // ...
8  },
9}

The Group Field inherits all of the default admin options from the base Field Admin Config, plus the following additional options:

Option

	

Description




hideGutter

	

Set this property to true to hide this field's gutter within the Admin Panel. The field gutter is rendered as a vertical line and padding, but often if this field is nested within a Group, Block, or Array, you may want to hide the gutter.

Example
1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
4  slug: 'example-collection',
5  fields: [
6    {
7      name: 'pageMeta',
8      type: 'group', // required
9      interfaceName: 'Meta', // optional
10      fields: [
11        // required
12        {
13          name: 'title',
14          type: 'text',
15          required: true,
16          minLength: 20,
17          maxLength: 100,
18        },
19        {
20          name: 'description',
21          type: 'textarea',
22          required: true,
23          minLength: 40,
24          maxLength: 160,
25        },
26      ],
27    },
28  ],
29}
Presentational group fields

You can also use the Group field to only visually group fields without affecting the data structure. Not defining a name will render just the grouped fields (no nested object is created). If you want the group to appear as a titled section in the Admin UI, set a label.

1import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
2

3export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
4  slug: 'example-collection',
5  fields: [
6    {
7      label: 'Page meta', // label only → presentational
8      type: 'group', // required
9      fields: [
10        {
11          name: 'title',
12          type: 'text',
13          required: true,
14          minLength: 20,
15          maxLength: 100,
16        },
17        {
18          name: 'description',
19          type: 'textarea',
20          required: true,
21          minLength: 40,
22          maxLength: 160,
23        },
24      ],
25    },
26  ],
27}

4  slug: 'example-collection',
5  fields: [
6    {
7      name: 'pageMeta', // name → nested object in data
8      label: 'Page meta',
9      type: 'group', // required
10      fields: [
11        {
